# Resources Webpage

My resources webpage that contains a list of all resources I have been collecting since I started learning web development.


## Description

Since I started learning web dev I have try several systems to save resources that I found useful. I tried bookmarks, excel lists but then decided to just create a simple github repo.

After finishing my bootcamp I decided and wanted to learn how Static Site Generators work so I thought my resources repo would be a great project to use.

First I tried with [Gatsby](), following [this tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-02-26-getting-started-with-gatsby-themes/) about getting started with Gatsby themes.

When I finished I realized that it was too much for what I wanted so decided to try [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

## Next Steps

- Deploy with [Netfly](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```
